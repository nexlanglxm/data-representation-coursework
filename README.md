# data-representation-coursework

this is where i am going to put all my wonderful work from September 23 semester in ATU DA

The ***assignments*** folder contains a record of files uploaded during the semester.

The ***extrafiles*** folder contains some throwaway files that were user-generated or downloaded during the semester.

The ***labs*** folder contains my work for the optional labs, and may not all be functioning or completed.

If you head into the ***project*** folder, you will find a further readme file which will detail the files in that folder.

# Project: Spotify Personalized Playlist Generator

## Description:- Briefly explain the purpose and functionality of the project.- Mention the integration with Spotify's API and the potential integration with Genius API later

## **Project Brief:**

Write a project that demonstrates that you understand creating and consuming RESTful APIs.

## Project Assessment Strategy

Level 1: 40-45%

- Basic FLASK server
- REST API (to perform CRUD operations)
- One database table
- Accompanying web interface, using AJAX calls, to perform CRUD operations

Level 2: 45-50%

- More than one database table

Level 3: 50-55%

- Uses authorization

EXTRAS:

Web page looks nice.                        + 0-10%
More complicated API.                       + 0-10%
Server links to a third party API.          + 0-10%
Third party API requires authentication.    + 0-10%
Hosted online (Pythonanywhere, Azure)       + 10%

## **Objective:**

- The main goals of the project:
- The development of a web application to generate personalized playlists based on user preferences.

## **Features and Functionality:**

- The core functionalities of the web application, such as:
- User input for favorite artists, genres, or songs.
- Interaction with the Spotify API to fetch and create playlists.
- Potential integration with the Genius API for song lyrics.

## **Technology Stack:**

- List of the technologies and frameworks I plan to use:
- Python for backend development.
- Flask for creating the RESTful API.
- Spotify API for music data.
- (Potentially) Genius API for song lyrics.

## **Development Steps:**

- Set up the folder environment.
- Develop this READme.md file.
- Set up Flask environment.
- Implement user input functionality.
- Integrate Spotify API for playlist creation.
- (Later stage) Integrate Genius API for song lyrics.

## **Folder Structure:**

- Separate folders for frontend, backend, API files, etc.
- The whole project is contained in a `project` folder.
- The `static` folder contains
- The `templates` folder contains the index html file, which will be displayed to the user.

## **Installation and Usage:**

- Guide users on how to set up and run the application:
- Installation steps for dependencies.
- Instructions for running the server and accessing the application.

## **References and Resources:**

- Including links to the Spotify API documentation [https://any-api.com/spotify_com/spotify_com/docs/API_Description], Genius API documentation (<https://rapidapi.com/Glavier/api/genius-song-lyrics1/>), and any other resources used.
